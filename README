jdmca 
=====

A small C program for displaying one-dimensional cellular automata.

I wrote this sometime in the early '90s. I was in college at the 
time but I created this for my own amusement. I had a CGI interface
for it that allowed you to browse the space of automata in a novel 
way. I'm going to try to recreate that and add it to this project. 

This is dependent on libgd. 

The jdmca program takes a number of options on the command line and
dumps a GIF file out to stdout. Sorry for the lack of documentation.
Use the source.
