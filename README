jdmca 
=====

A small C program for displaying one-dimensional cellular automata.

I wrote this sometime in the early '90s. I was in college at the 
time but I created this for my own amusement. I had a CGI interface
for it that allowed you to browse the space of automata in a novel 
way. I'm going to try to recreate that and add it to this project. 

This is dependent on libgd. 

The jdmca program takes a number of options on the command line and
dumps a GIF file out to stdout. Sorry for the lack of documentation.
Use the source. 

Overview
--------

This is an implementation of a class of 1D cellular automata where 
cells have one of two states and the neighborhood includes the cell,
the two neighbors to the left of the cell, and the two neighbors to 
the right. 

The "ruleset" for this class of CAs can be compactly represented as
a 32-bit value such as an 32-bit unsigned integer. The 5-bit
neighborhood is interpreted as an integer index between 0 and 31.
The 32-bit integer "ruleset" is right-shifted by that index value, 
and the result is bitwise-anded with 1 giving the value of its least
significant bit. This bit becomes the new value of the cell. 

The total number of rulesets for this class of CAs is, obviously,
2^32.
